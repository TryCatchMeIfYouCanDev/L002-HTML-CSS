# HTML Exercises Overview #

## Exercise 1 – W3C Mission Page  ##
The goal of this exercise was to recreate a **web page** inspired by the *W3C Mission* document.

The page includes:
- A **header** with the main title and introductory paragraph.  
- A **main section** divided into several subsections (`section` and `article`) describing the W3C’s vision, identity, design principles, and strategic goals.  
- Proper use of **semantic HTML** and **text formatting** elements such as `abbr`, `b`, `i`, and `a`.  
- Nested lists (`ul`, `ol`) and line breaks (`br`) to organize the content.

This exercise focused on **semantic structure**, **readability**, and the **correct use of HTML hierarchy**.

## Exercise 2 – Lists Practice  ##
The objective was to transform **four textual lists** into an HTML document.

The page required:
- Creating and nesting **ordered (`ol`)** and **unordered (`ul`)** lists.  
- Combining list types to represent subtopics and related modules.  
- Using **inline formatting** (`b`, `i`) and **escaped characters** such as `&lt;` and `&quot;`.  

This task emphasized **nested lists**, **hierarchical clarity**, and **proper indentation**.
